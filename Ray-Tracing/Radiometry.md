# Radiometry 

## Why(Motivation)

Whitted style ray tracing can't give you correct result.



## What's Radiometry

- Measurement system and units for illumination
- Accurately measure the spatial properties of light
  - New terms:
    - Radiant flux
    - intensity
    - irradiance
    - radiance
- Perform lighting calculations in a physically correct manner



## Terms

### Radiant Energy and Flux(Power)

**Radiant Energy** Definition: 
Radiant energy is the energy of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation). It is measured in units of joules, and denoted by the symbol: 



**Radiant Flux(Power)** Definition:

Radiant flux (power) is the energy emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit time.

Flux : #photons flowing through a sensor in uint time

### Important Light Measurements of Interest

- **Radiant Intensity**
  - Light Emitted From A Source
- **Irradiance**
  - Light Falling On A Surface
- **Radiance**

#### Radiant Intensity

Definition: The radiant (luminous) intensity is the power per unit [solid angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle) emitted by a point light source.

#### Irradiance
